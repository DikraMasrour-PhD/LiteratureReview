#### Motivation
Skipping neurons in FC layers scheme relies on the belief that in FC layers different neuron units are responsible for different features, and therefore not all neuron units need to be activated for each input sample.
#### Schemes
Most of the following techniques are included in the category of Conditional Computation.
